## Instructions

1. Using the **SQL Server Object Explorer** in Visual Studio, examine the tables, columns, and foreign keys of the database.
1. Using the `dbdiagram.io` site, create an ERD for the database.

For each of the following exercises, provide the appropriate query. Yes, even the ones that are expressed in the form of questions. Everything from class and the references listed above is fair game.

1. Query all of the entries in the `Genre` table
1. Query all the entries in the `Artist` table and order by the artist's name. HINT: use the ORDER BY keywords
1. Write a `SELECT` query that lists all the songs in the `Song` table and include the Artist name
1. Write a `SELECT` query that lists all the Artists that have a Pop Album
1. Write a `SELECT` query that lists all the Artists that have a Jazz or Rock Album
1. Write a `SELECT` statement that lists the Albums with no songs
1. Using the `INSERT` statement, add one of your favorite artists to the `Artist` table.
1. Using the `INSERT` statement, add one, or more, albums by your artist to the `Album` table.
1. Using the `INSERT` statement, add some songs that are on that album to the `Song` table.
1. Write a `SELECT` query that provides the song titles, album title, and artist name for all of the data you just entered in. Use the [`LEFT JOIN`](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-using-joins.htm) keyword sequence to connect the tables, and the `WHERE` keyword to filter the results to the album and artist you added.
    > **Reminder:** Direction of join matters. Try the following statements and see the difference in results.

    ```
    SELECT a.Title, s.Title FROM Album a LEFT JOIN Song s ON s.AlbumId = a.Id;
    SELECT a.Title, s.Title FROM Song s LEFT JOIN Album a ON s.AlbumId = a.Id;
    ```
1. Write a `SELECT` statement to display how many songs exist for each album. You'll need to use the `COUNT()` function and the `GROUP BY` keyword sequence.
1. Write a `SELECT` statement to display how many songs exist for each artist. You'll need to use the `COUNT()` function and the `GROUP BY` keyword sequence.
1. Write a `SELECT` statement to display how many songs exist for each genre. You'll need to use the `COUNT()` function and the `GROUP BY` keyword sequence.
1. Write a `SELECT` query that lists the Artists that have put out records on more than one record label. Hint: When using `GROUP BY` instead of using a `WHERE` clause, use the [`HAVING`](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-having-clause.htm) keyword
1. Using `MAX()` function, write a select statement to find the album with the longest duration. The result should display the album title and the duration.
1. Using `MAX()` function, write a select statement to find the song with the longest duration. The result should display the song title and the duration.
